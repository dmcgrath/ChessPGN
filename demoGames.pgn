{ pgn4web personal account on Kramnik and the Petrov, part 1: in October
1998, I watched this game live from the tournament hall in Tilburg. At some
point I was hoping to witness a masterpiece sacrifice win from Kramnik, but
apparently Anand was well prepared. }

Capablanca's times. } 10. Qb3 O-O 11. Nbd2 Na5 12. Qa4 { Later White tried
an alternative plan with Qc2 followed by b4 and rapid expansion on the
queenside, often preceeded by a repetition, as in } (12. Qa4 Nc6 13. Qb3

Anand-Kamnik at Wijk An Zee 1999 and in Shirov-Kramnik, Belgrade 1999 })
14. Nxd2 Qd6 { So far following Anand-Yusupov, Linares 1993, where 15. Nb3
ensued, eventually a draw. } 15. h3 { $1 This novelty was suggested by
Anand's second Ubilava after the game in Linares. 15. h3 diverts Black's
Bishop control of the e6 square and makes sure the h Pawn will not be
captured when the Black's Queen arrives on h2. This move was voted the 4th
most important novelty in Informant 74. } 15... Bh5 16. Nb3 Bh4 17. Nc5

prepared. } 18. Kxf2 Qh2 19. Bxc6 bxc6 20. Qxc6 f4 21. Qxd5+ Kh8 22. Qxh5

{ pgn4web personal account on Kramnik and the Petrov, part 2: since the
previous game at Tilburg 1998 I did not attend in person any other top
event until December 2009. More than 10 years had passed when I was in the
tournament hall in London, watching Kramnik sacrificing a piece in the same
variation of the Petrov. Again, I did not witness a masterpiece sacrifice
win from Kramnik, but the similarity between the two games amazed me. }
